I have found time to learn megapatch2 changes in SCPSL game.

Old repo is read-only from now.

# Preview

# Where's the hack?

The code is messy and dirty. I have to refactor everything from start.

Plus, dx11 hook is really pain in Unity3D games.

When the base will be ready I will release the code. Stay tuned.
