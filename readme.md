# il2cpp

I have found time to learn megapatch2 changes in SCPSL game.

Old repo is read-only from now.

# Preview

[![v0.4](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sm50fRX-E2I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm50fRX-E2I)

This project is a base for il2cpp game hack. You can make a couple changes to make it work with any other game, not SCPSL only.

# Updates

v0.4: hooking game thread to bypass GC detection.

# Code quality

I did all I could, personally for me the code looks pretty simple and nice.

GUI is a slightly remade code from [ExplosivePimple, 2013](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/arma-2-a/92280-source-external-directx-overlay.html) (Hooking DX in Unity3D games is pain).

# Credits

* [Foxye](https://github.com/EquiFox) for his public hack that gave me inspiration to continue.
* Allan for great w2s code and cool c++ snippets.
